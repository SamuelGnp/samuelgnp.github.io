<p>Hi and welcome to my blog!</p>

<p> I'm Samuel Gnap, a data science enthusiast and a bit of a number cruncher at heart. 
	Currently, I'm navigating the skies of data with easyJet in London, where I blend my love for numbers (and planes) 
	with real-world applications. My journey in this field started with a deep dive into 
	Quantitative Finance, and since then, it's been a thrilling ride through the realms of analytics and beyond.</p>

 <p>
	 In today's world, where AI and machine learning are the buzzwords, I often find myself drawn back 
	 to the roots of causal inference and the robust principles of econometrics. There's something fascinating 
	 about these "good old school" methods and how they can sometimes outshine even the most 
	 sophisticated machine learning models, depending on the problem at hand of course.
 </p>

 <p>
	 Through this blog, I aim to unravel the tapestry of traditional statistical techniques and how 
	 they still hold significant value in our increasingly AI-driven world. I believe that a blend of 
	 these classic methods with modern technology can lead to some really exciting insights and solutions. 
	 So, whether you're a data science newbie or a seasoned pro, I invite you to join me on this exploration 
	 of the less-traveled paths of data science, where we'll rediscover the charm of causal inference 
	 and econometrics in solving real-world problems.
